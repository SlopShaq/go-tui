# 24 - Markdown

Renders a markdown document with the `<markdown>` element inside a scrollable
container.

```bash
go run ../../cmd/tui generate markdown.gsx
go run .
```

## What it shows

- The `<markdown>` tag fed by a `source` expression with a responsive `width`:
  `mdWidth(app)` derives the width from `app.Size()`, so the text fills a wide
  terminal and wraps on a narrow one (re-evaluated on resize).
- A `MarkdownTheme` default styling headings, emphasis, inline code, code blocks,
  tables, lists, and blockquotes.
- The component wrapped in a bordered `overflow-y-scroll` container that grows to
  fill the height, with the title and help text outside the frame. `Markdown`
  owns no scroll state of its own.

The sample document in `main.go` exercises every supported construct:

- ATX headings (`#`..`######`) and single-line setext headings (`===`, `---`)
- Bold, italic, combined bold-italic, inline code, and links (OSC 8 on capable
  terminals), with both `*`/`_` and `**`/`__` markers
- Edge cases: a delimiter with no closer stays literal (`see **docs`, `3 * 4`)
- Fenced code blocks, including a preserved blank line
- Pipe tables rendered as a full grid (outer box, column separators, header
  rule) with inline formatting preserved in cells
- Unordered lists (`-`, `*`, `+`), ordered lists, and nesting
- Blockquotes, including a nested quote and a quote containing a list

## Controls

- `j` / `k` or arrow keys: scroll
- `PageUp` / `PageDown`: scroll a page
- mouse wheel: scroll
- `q` / `Esc`: quit

## Clicking links

Links render as OSC 8 hyperlinks on capable terminals (Ghostty, iTerm2, kitty,
WezTerm, and others). This example enables mouse reporting for wheel scrolling,
which means the terminal forwards plain clicks to the app instead of opening the
link itself. To follow a link while mouse reporting is active, hold the terminal's
bypass modifier (Shift in most terminals, including Ghostty) and click. A build
that does not call `tui.WithMouse()` makes links directly clickable.
